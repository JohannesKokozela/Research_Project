\title{
  Icelandic River Data
}
\description{
  Contains the Icelandic river data as presented in Tong (1990),
  pages 432--440.
}
\usage{
data(ice.river)
}
\format{
  4 univariate time series \code{flow.vat}, \code{flow.jok},
  \code{prec}, and \code{temp}, each with 1095 observations and the
  joint series \code{ice.river}.
} 
\details{
  The series are daily observations from Jan. 1, 1972 to Dec. 31, 1974
  on 4 variables: \code{flow.vat}, mean daily flow of Vatnsdalsa river
  (cms), \code{flow.jok}, mean daily flow of Jokulsa Eystri river (cms),
  \code{prec}, daily precipitation in Hveravellir (mm), and mean daily
  temperature in Hveravellir (deg C).

  These datasets were introduced into the literature in a paper by
  Tong, Thanoon, and Gudmundsson (1985).
